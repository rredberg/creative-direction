# creative-direction
Use mechanistic interpretability tools to explore how models express creativity.

I wanted to investigate whether the concept of “creativity” in LLMs requires higher-dimensional structure to be faithfully represented in a model’s activation space. Linear methods were able to nearly perfectly separate activations for “creative” versus “formal” prompts, suggesting that the evaluation primarily reflects the model’s ability to encode and distinguish between different sets of instructions.
